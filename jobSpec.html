<tr class="odd">
<td>Additional Postdoctoral Training</td>
<td>Conducting an additional postdoctoral fellowship.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Additional Advanced Degree*</td>
<td>Pursuing an additional advanced degree. Examples of additional degrees pursued by our fellows include a JD and a DDS.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Primarily Teaching</td>
<td>Individuals were defined as 'primarily teaching' if their teaching load was greater than their research load. To estimate load, we examined lists of classes taught alongside lists of publications.  Examples of job titles in this category include 'Lecturer,' 'Instructor,' and 'Assistant/Associate/Full Professor'.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Primarily Applied Research</td>
<td>Conducting research involving the practical application of science to solve a specific problem. Examples of research classified as 'applied' in this study included the development of assays for use in screening pharmaceutical targets, the toxicological screening of compounds to identify whether they may cause adverse health effects, epidemiological research to determine whether particular substances may be associated with negative health effects, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Primarily Basic Research</td>
<td>Conducting research to understand fundamental, 'basic,' natural processes or phenomena. Examples of research defined as 'basic' include understanding how DNA replication works, understanding the biological pathways responsible for the immune response, etc. While individuals may have been conducting a mix of basic and other types of research, they were defined as 'primarily basic research' if more than 50% of their recent publications reflected this definition.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Primarily Computational Research/Informatics</td>
<td>Primarily involved in developing new computational/statistical methods for analyzing complex data to solve problems, or specializing in the overall advancement of data analytics and visualization.  Individuals within this category frequently had backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, bioinformatics, or computer science. Examples of job titles within this category may include 'Assistant Professor,' 'Biostatistician,' 'Research Scientist,' etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Primarily Clinical Research</td>
<td>Conducting research aimed at developing and determining the safety and effectiveness of biologics, drugs, and devices intended for human use. We limited the definition of 'clinical research' to only include research that had reached the stage of including human subjects.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Primarily Clinical Practice*</td>
<td>Primarily involved in using established treatments to diagnose and/or care for patients. Examples include physicians, nurses, pharmacists, veterinarians, acupuncturists, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Regulatory Affairs</td>
<td>Primarily involved in either developing or enforcing regulations (such as those working for the FDA), or ensuring that regulated industries comply with regulations pertaining to their business. Examples of job titles within this category may include terms such as 'Regulatory Scientist,' 'Regulatory Affairs Manager,' 'Regulatory Toxicologist,' etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Science Administration/Project Management</td>
<td>Primarily involved in the administration/management of scientific programs or projects. This category specifically excludes those in grant administration, who are categorized separately within this study due to their volume. Examples of job titles within this category include 'Project Manager,' 'Director of Career Development,' 'Scientific Program Analyst,' etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Intellectual Property/Licensing and Patenting*</td>
<td>Primarily involved in patenting creations/inventions of the mind (ideas, concepts, etc.) and/or licensing use of these creations. Individuals in this category often have the term 'Patent Agent' within their job title.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Consulting*</td>
<td>Often including the term 'Consultant' within their job title, these individuals primarily provide expert advice in their specialty area, which is used to guide others in solving problems, developing strategic plans, providing a specific service, etc.  Examples in this study include those providing toxicological advice, veterinary advice, business advice, etc.  Medical Science Liaisons, because of their role as healthcare consulting professionals, were also classified within this group.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Science/Public Policy*</td>
<td>Primarily involved at the interface between science and policy. Individuals often communicate science to policymakers to help them make informed decisions regarding, for example, allocation of funds for a particular scientific endeavor. An example of a job title within this field includes 'Policy Analyst.'</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Science Writing or Communications</td>
<td>Primarily involved in writing/editing and improving scientific communication. Examples of job titles within this category may include terms such as 'Medical Writer, 'Science Writer,' 'Editor,' 'Proposal Developer,' 'Translator,' etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Grants Management*</td>
<td>Primarily involved in the management of grants, whether in the initial stages of determining priority areas for funding, or in other stages, such as grant review, or grant administration after a positive funding decision. Examples of job titles within this category may include 'Health Scientist Administrator,' and 'Program Director.'</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Business Development or Operations*</td>
<td>Primarily involved in developing or implementing strategies for expanding business opportunities (business development), or involved in optimizing the efficiency with which a business operates (business operations).

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Other</td>
<td>Involved in a field not readily specified by those above, typically in a non-science-related area. Examples of individuals at NIEHS within this field include a 'Textile Artist,' 'Wine-Maker,' etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Unknown or Undecided</td>
<td>Either the career outcome is unknown, or the job sector could not be determined. This category also includes individuals who are unemployed. In some cases, it was challenging to distinguish whether an individual was 'unemployed,' or whether their career outcome was unknown (Based on anecdotal evidence, we estimate that ~2% are 'unemployed,' which also matches the estimates within the 2012 NIH Biomedical Workforce Report).</td>
