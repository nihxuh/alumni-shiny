<p>Postdoctoral scholars are highly-skilled scientists that, classically, have been trained to enter into academic tenure-track positions. However, the number of these tenure-track positions is remaining largely flat while the number of postdoctoral fellows is increasing, meaning that many scientists will enter into other types of careers <span class="citation">(Cyranoski et al. 2011)</span>. To make informed decisions about these careers, scholars need institution-level knowledge about their options. Institutions have been implored to collect and report this information for decades, but a lack of standard career outcome taxonomies and visualization methodologies has severely impeded progress. Here, we address these impediments by developing a three-tiered, hierarchical taxonomy and visualization methodology—creating standard definitions for: A) job sectors (six); B) job types (seven); and C) job specifics (twenty)—that will empower meaningful cross-institutional career outcome comparisons on a global scale. Applying our methods to intramural NIEHS alumni (50/50 U.S. versus international), we report the first account of detailed career outcomes for all postdoctoral scholars present at NIH | NIEHS within the past 15 years, which revealed striking differences among subpopulations. U.S. scholars enter into the for-profit sector in professional job-types conducting applied research at a much higher rate than international scholars. International scholars enter the academic sector in tenure-track job-types conducting basic research at twice the rate of U.S. scholars—but they predominantly enter into these positions outside of the U.S. Conversely, U.S. scholars constitute the majority of those entering into tenure-track positions within the U.S. The percentage of individuals entering into tenure-track positions also varied widely by discipline, with those in biostatistics/computational biology leading the pack. We envisage that the standard taxonomy and visualization methods described here can be broadly applied to ascertain the finely-tuned career outcomes of postdoctoral scholars on a global scale.</p>
