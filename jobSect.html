<tr class="even">
<td>Non-profit Organization</td>
<td>Includes organizations which do not make a profit. Research institutes and hospitals functioning outside of a university or medical school are included within this group.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Independent/Self-Employed</td>
<td>Includes individuals unaffiliated with a primary outside organization. These individuals are often employed as freelance writers or they hold temporary independent contract positions. Those who own their own company would be included within this category.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Unknown or Undecided</td>
<td>Either the career outcome is unknown, or the job sector could not be determined. This category also includes individuals who are unemployed. In some cases, it was challenging to distinguish whether an individual was 'unemployed,' or whether their career outcome was unknown (Based on anecdotal evidence, we estimate that ~2% are 'unemployed,' which also matches the estimates within the 2012 NIH Biomedical Workforce Report).</td>
