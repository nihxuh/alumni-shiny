<h3>Obtaining and Processing Alumni Data</h3>
<p>We identified all NIEHS postdoctoral scholars who became alumni within the January 2000-December 2019 time-frame by examining NIEHS administrative records, and filtering based on when individuals started and ended their training fellowships. Filtering these records resulted in 1102 postdoctoral alumni within the twenty-year time frame specified. We note that the completeness of our dataset relies on how robustly records are maintained. Minimal clerical errors are essential to obtaining a complete list of alumni. After obtaining this list, we identified career outcomes by searching publicly available information. It should be noted that at least one other identifying factor besides "name" had to be present to ensure we had found the correct person. For example, if a past NIEHS affiliation was not obvious, we searched for other identifying factors such as degree type and year, which was known from NIEHS records. After identifying alumni, we also determined the fields in which they obtained advanced degrees, and classified these degrees according to the taxonomy developed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) for standard comparison <span class="citation">(National Center for Education Statistics 2010)</span>.  The following protocol describes the methodology we employed for finding alumni:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search LinkedIn by alumni name and obtain career outcomes if there are matching results. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>Search ResearchGate by alumni names and obtain career outcomes if there are matching results. Otherwise, proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>Search PubMed by both alumni names and NIEHS mentor names, and trace forward to their latest career positions. If there is no matching result, proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>Use Google to search alumni names plus "NIEHS", and/or plus "PhD" (or the appropriate degree). Filter Google results with additional alumni information as mentioned before. If there is no matching result, proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>If online searches failed to produce results, we examined past NIEHS 'Board of Scientific Counselor' laboratory review packages (similar to NIH grant progress reports) which include career outcomes for laboratory alumni.</li>
<li>When all strategies were exhausted, their career outcome is dubbed "Unknown".</li>
</ul>

<h3>Creating a Career Outcome Taxonomy and Classifying Individuals</h3>
<p>In 2013, we began a pilot effort to identify the careers that NIEHS alumni were engaged in. Initially, we classified their careers using the methodology within the 2012 NIH BWF, but we ultimately decided that reporting outcomes in this manner yielded results that were too vague. In 2014, the NIH Intramural Research Program requested information on alumni career outcomes from each NIH Institute. In response to this request, we developed a three-tiered, hierarchical career outcome taxonomy that followed a progression from broad to increasingly more specific—thus classifying alumni by 'job sector,' 'job type' and 'job specifics;' our system was adopted by the NIH Division of Intramural Research in July 2014. In developing our system, we began with minimal preconceptions about how to classify the data and followed a 'bottom-up' approach to decide how to best logically parse the career outcomes that we already knew from the 2013 pilot study. After developing categories for these outcomes, we crafted standard definitions for each categorical component to ensure consistency when classifying individuals. The standard definitions (see Supplementary Tables 1-3) were created 'in parallel' with categorizing alumni—this process was made possible by researching their career details in order to methodically and consistently assign individuals to a group within each tier while simultaneously using the 'career detail' information to hone standard definitions. Using this methodology provides an advantage over prior studies, which have partially relied on classifying individuals based primarily on their job titles. Our work revealed that relying on job titles alone does not paint a full picture of the true nature of an individual's work. For example, some individuals have a job title of 'Health Scientist,' while their day-to-day work encompasses directing a training program for scientists. In this case, classifying by the job title alone may have led to the incorrect assumption that an individual was conducting bench research, when in fact, they were engaged in science administration and project management. Therefore, delving beyond job titles in order to research career details helped us to concomitantly develop a taxonomy and classify individuals within it through trial-and-error. Researching these details included tasks such as reading individuals' publication abstracts, CVs (when publicly available online), LinkedIn summaries, grant application summaries from NIH RePORTER, and/or examining the overall nature of the work being conducted by employers in order to gain a clearer understanding of alumni careers. In many cases, we found that individuals were engaged in multiple areas—for example, conducting both applied, basic, and clinical research. In those cases, we examined both the quantity of papers and the position of authorship on papers in order to estimate the type of research a given alum was most involved in. As a word on the feasibility of reproducing this effort—characterization was largely straightforward, and only a few required extensive research to appropriately classify them. We acknowledge, though, that classifying individuals by hand involves making assumptions—especially regarding job types and job specifics. However, now that the leg-work required to create a set of standard definitions has been accomplished here, these definitions could be displayed within surveys if institutions were to choose to ascertain career outcomes in this manner. Surveys that include defined terms would result in more robust data due to the combined effect of coupling additional clarity with a reduction in assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A key strength of this taxonomy lies in how each tier captures distinct, largely non-overlapping aspects of careers, allowing for more finely-tuned information to be determined as one moves from the 'job sectors' all the way to the 'job specifics.' In this taxonomy, we dissect not only the proportion of individuals in a particular job type (for example, tenure-track) within a given sector, but we analyze the specifics of the research (or other job function) they are performing (ex: basic, applied, clinical, etc.) within these positions. We feel there is value in ascertaining these specifics, especially given that we see dramatic, statistically significant career outcome differences associated with them.

<h3>Analysis and Visualization of Career Outcomes</h3>
<p>To analyze alumni career data, we used open source R language (<a href="http://www.R-project.org/" class="uri">http://www.R-project.org/</a>) and RStudio (<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/" class="uri">http://www.rstudio.com/</a>) to visualize data. Job location data were plotted as a circular migration map (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=migest" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=migest</a>) and state distribution map (<a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=choroplethr" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=choroplethr</a>). The connections between the three job categories were plotted as a Sankey diagram using the networkD3 R package (<a href="hhttps://CRAN.R-project.org/package=networkD3" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=networkD3</a>). Demographic data was plotted as diverging stacked bar charts, and the remaining plots were generated with the R package ggplot2 (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2</a>). All plots were annotated and formatted with Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<h3>Statistical Analysis of Career Outcomes</h3>
<p>Statistical tests were performed using open source R language. A Chi-square test was performed to compare career outcome differences between two groups, such as between visiting scholars vs. non-visiting scholars, or between NIEHS alumni vs. postdocs within the 2012 NIH BWF report. When multiple comparisons were performed, p-values were adjusted using the Bonferroni correction.</p>
