<td>Tenure-Track Faculty</td>
<td>Faculty-like, tenured or tenure-eligible positions primarily found within academia, government, and nonprofit organizations, typically holding titles of 'Assistant', 'Associate' or 'Full Professor' (within academia), or other titles such as 'Principal Investigator', 'Group Leader', or 'Principal Scientist' (within other sectors).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Non-Tenure-Track Faculty</td>
<td>Faculty-like positions that are ineligible for tenure.  Individuals classified into this job type frequently conduct independent research or teach, mostly within the academic sector. The most common job title was 'Research Assistant Professor.' Examples of other job titles included 'Assistant Professor' or 'Assistant Research Professor.'</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Professional Staff</td>
<td>Broad term describing non-faculty positions; this category includes those conducting independent work but not supervising a large team. Examples of individuals within this category may include staff scientists working within government, staff working within for-profit companies in a range of areas such as basic and applied research, product development, business development, intellectual property, etc.  Those teaching outside of a university or college (high school, for example) are classified within this group.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Support Staff</td>
<td>Refers to those not leading independent efforts but primarily supporting the work of others. Examples of those included within this job type include laboratory technicians, those working within core facilities, and those providing technical or customer support.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Management</td>
<td>Refers to those leading or managing large teams or efforts, often with the word 'Director' as part of their job title. These positions are frequently held by those with more years of experience, who have had the chance to rise within the ranks of their field.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Trainee</td>
<td>Conducting additional training. Examples include those conducting additional postdoctoral training, those pursing additional fellowships (such as the FDA Commissioner's Fellowships), or those pursuing an additional degree, such as a JD or DDS.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Unknown or Undecided</td>
<td>Either the career outcome is unknown, or the job sector could not be determined. This category also includes individuals who are unemployed. In some cases, it was challenging to distinguish whether an individual was 'unemployed,' or whether their career outcome was unknown (Based on anecdotal evidence, we estimate that ~2% are 'unemployed,' which also matches the estimates within the 2012 NIH Biomedical Workforce Report).</td>
